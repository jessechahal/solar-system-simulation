Intro
---

So I got bored one day and decided to remind myself how to do some basic game development stuff using the latest Unity. I created a simple solar system demo that currently only includes the sun, earth, and moon. If I feel like its worth it I might add in the other planents as I already have the NASA textures of them. 

Controls

The only thing you can do is click on the different celestial bodies to move the camera to follow them. Clicking on the Sun will recenter you.
